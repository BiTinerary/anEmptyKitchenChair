# anEmptyKitchenChair
Context sheds light on Truth. Without it, your perspective is in the dark. In honor of the unjustly departed.

### Why?
**Everytime** someone rattles off names of an individuals unjustly killed by police, there's always been **one** more name I didn't recognize. As result, I always felt the need to know who they were, to know their story.

When I came across the Washington Posts [data-police-shootings](https://github.com/washingtonpost/data-police-shootings) repo I felt a little less, powerless. These are my efforts to make sense of it all.

Victim, criminal, servant or otherwise. This is in dedication of everyone **affected** by the loss of life represented by each headstone above. You've kept me awake at night.
