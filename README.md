# anEmptyKitchenChair
Context sheds light on Truth. Without it, your perspective is in the dark. In honor of the unjustly departed.

### Why?
**Everytime** someone rattles off names of an individuals unjustly killed by police, there's always been **one** more name I didn't recognize. As result, I always felt the need to know who they were. This is a means in which to do that more quickly.

"How could they be forgotten? How am I only hearing about this, now!? ... Lumped in with so many other people? Who **else** haven't I heard of?"

Victim, criminal, servant or otherwise. This is in dedication of everyone **affected** by the loss of every life represented by a headstone above.
