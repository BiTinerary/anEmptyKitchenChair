# anEmptyKitchenChair
Context sheds light on Truth. Without it, your perspective is in the dark. In honor of the unjustly departed.

### Why?
**Everytime** someone rattles off a name of an individual killed by police, there's always been **one** more name I didn't recognize. As result it creates a splinter in my mind to know more. "How could they be forgotten? How am I only hearing about this, now!? ... Lumped in with so many other people? Who **else** haven't I heard of?"  

The repo's name was appropriately inspired by a line in this song, listened to for the first time just a couple days ago.

Victim, criminal, servant or otherwise. This is in dedication of everyone **affected** by the loss of every life represented by a headstone above.
