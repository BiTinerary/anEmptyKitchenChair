# anEmptyKitchenChair
Context sheds light on Truth. Without it, your perspective is in the dark. In honor of the unjustly departed.

### Why?
**Everytime** someone rattles off a name of an individual killed by police, there's always been **one** more name I didn't recognize. As result it creates a splinter in my mind to know more. Unfortunately, that splinter turns out to be years old and increasingly horrendous and unjust in context.

I don't know if it was losing a childhood friend (Chester Bennington), a neighbor (Justine Damon) or constantly reminded of the fragility of Life by becoming a Father in the span of a month, or a combination of it all, but this project will keep me awake at night until it's finished.

The repo's name was appropriately inspired by a line in this song, listened to for the first time just a couple days ago.

Victim, criminal, servant or otherwise. This is in dedication of everyone **affected** by the loss of every life represented by a headstone above.
