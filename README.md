# anEmptyKitchenChair
Context sheds light on Truth. Without it, your perspective is in the dark. In honor of the unjustly departed.

### What?
Use The Gaurdian's and Washington Posts databases of police involved deaths and shooting deaths, respectively, to download and organize 'eye witness' perspective provided by youtube video of body cams, dash cams and cell phone footage where available. Along with article .htmls, official police reports .pdfs and, etc...

### How
Automate Google searches for each of the deceased names + "Police Shooting" and collect the top three results. Download each of these youtube videos/htmls/pdfs and store offline.

Automation/offline content allows for:
* Updating cases as more content comes out and trials/lawsuits/prosecutions are finalized.
* Automating parts of the manual process involved in updating databases with more info.
* Prevent potential censorship

### Why?
**Everytime** someone rattles off names of an individuals unjustly killed by police, there's always been **one** more name I didn't recognize. As result, I always felt the need to know who they were, to know their story. When I came across the Washington Posts [data-police-shootings](https://github.com/washingtonpost/data-police-shootings) repo I felt a little less, powerless. These are my efforts to make sense of it all.

Victim, criminal, servant or otherwise. This is in dedication of everyone **affected** by the loss of life represented by each headstone above. You've kept me awake at night.

### Inaccuracies
Think about it, not all search results provide you with the exact content you're looking for. As such, some links are for unrelated material. For instance, common names + Police shootings might return a result for a different person (not killed by police) involved in a completely different set of circumstances. Additionally, if the case doesn't have an online presence, I've seen some links that go to a wikipedia page for someone completely irrelevant. Keep these facts in mind. This is why three results are returned and the innaccuracies are well worth the over all effectiveness of the project. More will be done later on to correct this information, manually.
